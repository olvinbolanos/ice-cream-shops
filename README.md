## Layout

This website is made with all the CRUD functionality and uses an api to render all the information from the Yelp developer site. It fetches the information from the front-end and stores the user's information on Firebase. This was basically a fun site to build and it presented me to Firebase storage and authentication. Which is really easy to use and good for deploying a project.

##Set Up

1. The backend was all through Firebase and React.Context. I basically connected the database through firebase.context and was easily made for information to be accessible to the user.

2. The modal was designed through React and Bootstrap on the design part. It goes through three images that automatically run through an interval on JQuery's side.

## Instructions

In order to run this site. Clone it and npm start to start running it on your browser... It's that simple but do npm install all your modules beforehand in order for it to work.
